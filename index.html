        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hola, my name is SajjalZia" width="200">
        <p> Hola! Mucho Gusto. My name is Sajjal Zia and I'm from Pakistan, a country full of colors and taste. I rejoice in being a woman in the kingdom of God. 
            I'm currently studying software development at BYUI online. I'm fond of music, sketching, playing badminton, and learning new languages. 
            I'm currently working on learning Spanish and German. They both are different from each other but I like to learn them both. I also enjoy serving and teaching.
            I'm a return missionary and have served in the Philippines, Antipolo mission. I have also served as a Pathway-Connect service missionary. 
            I'm also into writing and have written poems and articles. My favorite genre is spirituality and motivation. 
            My motto for life 'to be a good example' revolves around the verse: "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good work and glorify your Father in Heaven."
